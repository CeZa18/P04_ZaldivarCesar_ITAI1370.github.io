        <h2>What are QR Codes and how do they work?</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>QR code</strong> is a two-dimensional (2D) matrix barcode. Unlike
            traditional barcodes, it stores information both horizontally and vertically.
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It uses a series of black squares arranged on a grid. 
                Three large squares in the corners (position detection patterns) help 
                the scanner determine the code’s orientation and structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> It typically triggers an action, such as opening a URL,
                     downloading a file, or in the case of AR, launching a 3D digital overlay.</li>
            </ul>
            
        </p>

        <h2>History of QR Codes</h2>
        <p>
            The QR code system originated in Japan and was developed by engineers at
            <strong>DENSO WAVE</strong>, an auto-parts manufacturing company for Toyota.
            The system was created in the 1990s to overcome the limitations of traditional barcodes,
            which could only store about 20 alphabetic characters.
        </p>

        <p>
            By using both horizontal and vertical data storage, QR codes greatly increased
            information capacity. The addition of position detection patterns allowed scanners
            to read the codes quickly and accurately.

        <h2>What are Barcodes and how do they work?</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>barcode</strong> is a one-dimensional (1D) code represented by
            parallel black lines and white spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
            Barcodes are read by laser or optical scanners that measure light reflected
            from the spaces between the bars.
        </p>

        <p>
            They are commonly used for inventory tracking and retail purposes,
            such as UPC codes found on products.

        <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages for AR</h2>

        <h3>QR Codes for AR</h3>
        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> High data capacity and easy recognition from different angles.</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can appear visually distracting in designs.</p>

        <h3>Barcodes for AR</h3>
        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Familiar and commonly used in retail environments.</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited data and poor performance for 3D tracking.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Why are QR Codes more suitable for AR?</h2>
        <p>
            QR codes provide better support for augmented reality because of their
            square shape, high data capacity, and built-in error correction.
            These features allow QR codes to act as spatial anchors that keep
            digital objects aligned even as the user moves.
