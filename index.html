        <h2>What are QR Codes and how do they work?</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>QR code</strong> is a two-dimensional (2D) matrix barcode. Unlike
            traditional barcodes, it stores information both horizontally and vertically.
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It uses a series of black squares arranged on a grid. 
                Three large squares in the corners (position detection patterns) help 
                the scanner determine the code’s orientation and structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> It typically triggers an action, such as opening a URL,
                     downloading a file, or in the case of AR, launching a 3D digital overlay.</li>
            </ul>
            
        </p>

        <h2>History of QR Codes</h2>
        <p>
            The QR code system originated in Japan and was developed by engineers at
            <strong>DENSO WAVE</strong>, an auto parts manufacturing company affiliated with Toyota.
            The development team was led by <strong>Masahiro Hara</strong>, with contributions from 
            <strong>Atsushi Tano</strong>, who worked in system solutions. The technology was created in the 1990s
            to address the growing limitations of traditional barcodes, which had been
            widely used during the 1980s to track automotive parts.
        </p>

        <p>
            As manufacturing processes became more complex, the barcode system reached its capacity limits. 
            Traditional barcodes could store only about 20 alphanumeric characters and often required multiple 
            barcodes to be scanned simultaneously to access sufficient information. In 1992, Masahiro Hara 
            was tasked with developing a more efficient scanning system that could handle increased data 
            demands across multiple production sites.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike one-dimensional barcodes, which store data only in a horizontal direction, 
            QR codes are two-dimensional and store information both horizontally and vertically. 
            This design significantly increased data capacity and scanning efficiency. To further 
            improve performance, the QR code incorporated position detection patterns—large square 
            markers located at three corners of the code. These patterns allow scanners to quickly 
            recognize the code’s orientation, enabling fast and accurate reading even under challenging 
            conditions (QR Code Development Story｜Technologies｜DENSO WAVE, n.d.).

        <h2>What are Barcodes and how do they work?</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>barcode</strong> is a one-dimensional (1D) code represented by
            parallel black lines and white spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The barcode is read by a laser or optical scanner 
                    that measures the light reflected off the white spaces between the black bars.</li>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> It is primarily used for inventory tracking and retail 
                    (UPC codes). It identifies a specific product but usually requires a connection 
                    to a database to provide detailed information. In AR, barcodes can serve as simple 
                     markers but offer limited functionality compared to QR codes.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages for AR</h2>

        <h3>QR Codes for AR</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> High data density allows them to point directly to complex AR assets; 
                    they are easily recognized by smartphone cameras from various angles.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> They can be aesthetically "busy" or distracting when placed on a design.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Barcodes for AR</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Familiar in retail settings; can be used to pull up product reviews or "try-on" features in-store.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Very limited data; the scanner must be relatively level with the code, making "tracking" a 3D object difficult.</li>
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Why are QR Codes more suitable for AR?</h2>
        <p>
            QR codes are the superior choice for AR for three main reasons:
            <ol></ol>
                <li><strong>3D Tracking (Pose Estimation):</strong> Because a QR code has distinct corners and a square shape, 
                    AR software can use it as a spatial anchor. This allows the digital object to stay "pinned" to the code even as you move your phone around it.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Volume:</strong> AR experiences often require large URLs or data strings to load 3D models. QR codes can handle this; barcodes cannot.</li>
                <li><strong>Readability:</strong> QR codes have built-in error correction. In AR, 
                    where lighting might be uneven or the user's hand might shake, the QR code remains functional while a barcode might fail.</li>
            </ol>
